## 1. Introduction: The Enclosure as Infrastructure

The frame is rarely perceived as an object in its own right; rather, it is viewed as a subservient boundary, a delimiter that separates the "work" from the "world." However, when analyzed in aggregate, the totality of framing systems—from the gilded moldings of the Louvre to the sonic-welded polycarbonate slabs encasing rookie cards, and from the extruded aluminum of airport signage to the invisible parametric boundaries of digital CAD models—constitutes a massive, distributed infrastructure. This "containing frames" hyperobject dictates how human culture is preserved, presented, and valued. It is a system governed by rigorous, often invisible, standards of metrology, material physics, and industrial tolerance.

This report conducts a deep structural analysis of this hyperobject, dissecting the classifications, subfamilies, and mechanical logics that define the architecture of enclosure. The investigation reveals that the frame is not merely a static border but a dynamic negotiation between the internal forces of the contained object (hygroscopic expansion, static charge, aesthetic weight) and the external pressures of the environment (humidity, gravity, actinic radiation). Whether through the ancient geometry of the *cyma recta* or the modern friction-fit of the silicone edge graphic (SEG), the engineering of the frame remains a fundamental, if overlooked, pillar of material culture.

## 2. The Traditional Frame: Wood, Geometry, and the Archival Micro-Environment

The traditional picture frame, typically constructed of wood or metal, represents the ancestral lineage of the container. It has evolved from an integral architectural element (as seen in altarpieces) to an interchangeable, customizable vessel. Its anatomy is defined by a precise nomenclature that serves critical conservation functions, balancing aesthetic projection with physical protection.

### 2.1 The Structural Anatomy: Rabbet, Lip, and the Physics of Allowance

The functional heart of any traditional frame is the **rabbet** (or rebate), an L-shaped recess cut into the rear inner edge of the moulding. The geometry of the rabbet acts as the primary constraint for the "art stack"—the sandwich of glazing, mat board, mount board, and backing board that constitutes the preserved object.

*   **Rabbet Depth and Capacity**: The depth of the rabbet is the vertical measurement from the underside of the lip to the back of the frame. This dimension dictates the frame's carrying capacity. Standard commercial profiles typically offer a rabbet depth ranging from **3/8 inch (9.5mm)** to **5/8 inch (16mm)**. This is generally sufficient for a basic stack consisting of a 4-ply mat, a print on paper, glazing, and a foam core backing.
*   **Deep Profiles**: The requirements of conservation framing introduce significant volume to the stack. To prevent "Newton's rings" (interference patterns caused by glass touching glossy surfaces) and mold growth due to condensation transfer, spacers or 8-ply rag mats are employed to loft the glazing away from the artwork. Consequently, professional standards often necessitate deeper profiles, ranging from **3/4 inch** to **1-1/2 inches**, to accommodate these archival breathing rooms.
*   **The Lip and Visual Occlusion**: The **rabbet width** corresponds to the **lip** of the frame—the ledge against which the glazing rests. This measurement determines the extent of visual occlusion. Standard framing practice dictates that the lip will obscure approximately **3mm to 5mm** (roughly 1/8 to 1/4 inch) of the artwork's perimeter. This "visual bite" is a structural necessity to retain the stack but must be accounted for.
*   **The Necessity of Allowance**: Perhaps the most critical, yet frequently misunderstood, dimension in professional framing is the **allowance**. Professional standards, such as those promulgated by the Fine Art Care and Treatment Standards (FACTS), mandate a standard allowance of **1/8 inch (3.175 mm)** be added to the frame’s internal dimensions relative to the size of the art stack. This 1/8-inch gap is not a margin for manufacturing error; it is a functional expansion joint. Hygroscopic materials like paper, wood, and cotton rag matboard absorb and release moisture in response to relative humidity (RH) fluctuations.

### 2.2 Taxonomy of Moulding Profiles: The Classical Orders

The geometry of the frame moulding—the **profile**—is a study in the manipulation of light and shadow, deeply rooted in the classical architectural orders of Greece and Rome.

| Profile Classification | Geometric Characteristics | Historical & Functional Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bevel** | A flat planar surface angled away from the perpendicular axis (chamfer). | Creates a clean, modern transition that directs the viewer's gaze inward. |
| **Scoop (Cavetto)** | A concave curve receding from a high outer edge to a low inner lip. | A traditional profile that draws the eye deeply into the image, simulating a window or portal. |
| **Reverse Scoop (Ovolo)** | A convex profile rising from a low outer edge to a high inner lip. | Projects the artwork forward into the viewer's space. Often used for dramatic or ornate presentations. |
| **Ogee (Cyma)** | A compound 'S' curve consisting of tangent convex and concave arcs. | The quintessential classical molding. Creates a complex rhythm of light and shadow (chiaroscuro). |
| **Floater (L-Shape)** | An 'L' profile with a vertical side and bottom reveal, lacking a front lip. | Creates the illusion of the artwork floating within the frame. Specifically engineered for gallery-wrapped canvases. |

## 3. The Mechanics of Tension: Canvas and Textile Systems

While works on paper rely on the frame for support and compression, textiles and canvases rely on **tension**. In this subfamily of the hyperobject, the frame acts as an exoskeleton that maintains the dimensional stability of the flexible substrate against the forces of relaxation and gravity.

### 3.1 Dynamic Stretcher Geometry

The foundational element of canvas framing is the **stretcher bar**.
*   **Keying**: Canvas fibers relax over time. To counteract this, small wooden wedges known as **keys** are inserted into slots in the inner corners of the stretcher bars. Driving these keys deeper into the joint forces the miter apart, expanding the frame's outer dimensions and restoring tension.
*   **Profile Depths**:
    *   **Standard Stretch (0.75")**: Designed to fit inside a traditional frame rabbet.
    *   **Gallery Wrap (1.5")**: A deeper, robust profile intended for frameless display.
    *   **Museum Wrap (2.0"+)**: Used for large-format works to prevent bowing.

### 3.2 Silicone Edge Graphics (SEG): The Industrial Tension Standard

In the commercial sector, **Silicone Edge Graphics (SEG)** represent the industrialization of tension framing.
*   **The Keder Interface**: A flexible silicone strip (keder/gasket) is sewn onto the perimeter of a dye-sublimated fabric graphic.
*   **Extrusion Standards**:
    *   **Channel Width**: Typically **3mm**.
    *   **Channel Depth**: Ranges from **10mm to 15mm** (12mm standard).
    *   **Keder Dimensions**: Typically **3mm x 12mm**.
*   **Metrology**: Measurements must be taken from the **outer interior edge** of the channel. A deviation of even a few millimeters can result in sagging or bowing.

## 4. Industrial Enclosure: Snap Frames and Illuminated Display

### 4.1 The Snap Frame Mechanism

The snap frame utilizing a spring-loaded hinge mechanism integrated directly into the aluminum extrusion profile.
*   **Assembly Logic**: Base Profile, Spring Steel (tension engine), Cover Profile (snaps open/shut), and Backing/Lens.
*   **Profile Standards**:
    *   **25mm (1 inch)**: Standard for small/medium sizes (A4 to A1).
    *   **32mm (1.25 inch)**: Greater rigidity for large formats (A0, 30"x40") and outdoor use.
*   **Visual Occlusion**: The mechanism typically obscures **10mm to 12mm** of the poster margin ("visual bite").

### 4.2 Illuminated Containment: The LED Lightbox

*   **Super Slim Frames**: Depths as shallow as **18mm to 35mm** using edge-lit LGPs (Light Guide Plates).
*   **Deep Profiles**: **80mm - 160mm** for large-format backlit textile frames with "ladder lights".

## 5. The Encapsulation of Value: Collectible Slabs and Capsules

### 5.1 The Slab Wars: Dimensional Geopolitics

There is no universal standard for trading card slabs; each major grading company has developed a proprietary form factor.

| Grading Company | Width (in) | Height (in) | Thickness (in) | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PSA** | 3.25" | 5.375" | 0.25" | The market baseline. Slim profile. |
| **BGS (Beckett)** | 3.20" | 5.125" | 0.375" | The thickest standard slab ("brick-like"). |
| **SGC** | 3.392" | 5.460" | 0.3225" | The "Tuxedo" slab. Widest standard. |
| **CGC / CSG** | 3.125" | 5.25" | ~0.20" | Very slim profile, high optical clarity. |

### 5.2 Numismatic Containment

*   **Direct-Fit**: Engineered to exact mintages (tolerance < 0.1mm). E.g., Silver Eagle = 40.6mm.
*   **Ring-Fit**: Standardized outer shells (Small ~30.9mm, Medium ~36.24mm, Large ~44.45mm) with foam inserts.

## 6. The Wearable Frame: Identity, Access, and CR80

The ID badge is a frame worn on the body, governed by **ISO 7810 (ID-1 / CR80)**.
*   **Dimensions**: **85.60mm x 53.98mm** x **0.76mm**.
*   **Slot Punch**: Standard oblong shape **1/8" x 9/16"** (3mm x 14mm), positioned **3/8"** from the top edge.

include <BOSL2/beziers.scad>

function ogee_profile(w, d) = 
    bez_path([
        [0,0], [w/3, 0], // Bottom flat
        [w/2, d/4], [w/2, d*0.75], // S-curve inflection
        [w, d], // Top lip
        [w, d-5] // Rabbet return
