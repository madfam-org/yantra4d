## The Yantra4D Manifesto: Ontology, Boundaries, and the Digital Commons

In an era where digital fabrication bridges the gap between pure code and physical reality, traditional open-source models are no longer sufficient. We are no longer simply sharing static files; we are generating systems, ecosystems, and parametric entities that exist simultaneously as software, mathematics, and physical matter.

To govern this new reality, we must build a legal and philosophical architecture that reflects the nature of the objects themselves. This manifesto outlines the governing principles of **Yantra4D** (our configurator, visualizer, and editor) and the **4D Bounded Hyperobjects Commons Library**.

By aligning the tenets of Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) with strictly defined open-source licensing, we are establishing a sustainable Algorithmic Studio. Here, the tragedy of the commons is defeated not by restricting access, but by mathematically and legally enforcing reciprocity exactly where it matters. We operate on the absolute principle that Form Follows Finance—the legal and economic codes dictate the survival of the physical form.

### I. The Ontological Premise: The Object and the Bounder

In a flat ontology, objects—whether they are algorithmic node-graphs, mathematical manifests, or physical biophilic structural joints—exist independently and equally. They interact, they aggregate, but they maintain their distinct boundaries.

The crisis of the modern digital commons occurs when these boundaries are ignored. When a corporation strip-mines an open-source library, they subsume the object into a proprietary monolith without contributing to its evolution. Conversely, when copyleft licenses are applied too bluntly (the "viral" effect), objects are legally forbidden from interacting with anything outside their open-source ecosystem, stifling their adoption and rendering them useless to the wider world.

Our solution is the **Bounder Mechanism**. Every 4D Bounded Hyperobject in our commons is accompanied by a Manifest. This Manifest is not mere documentation; it is the ontological and legal definition of the object's boundary. It defines the parametric limits, the kinematic logic, and the precise topological mating surfaces (the "External Interfaces").

By defining the Bounder, we dictate exactly where the open commons ends and where the proprietary assembly begins.

### II. The Engine of Creation: Yantra4D (AGPLv3)

**Yantra4D** is the factory floor. It is the visualizer, the editor, and the solver that allows users to manipulate the boundaries of our hyperobjects.

As the means of production, Yantra4D must be protected from monopolistic capture. Therefore, the core engine, UI, and backend infrastructure of Yantra4D are licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

* **The Defense of the Studio:** The AGPLv3 closes the "SaaS loophole." If an enterprise entity attempts to host Yantra4D as a proprietary web service, or modifies our node-based geometry factory to serve their own closed ecosystem, they are legally compelled to publish their entire backend source code.
* **The Commercial Bridge:** Yantra4D remains entirely free for any user to operate, locally or internally, to design and compute geometry. However, those who wish to commercialize the *platform itself* without contributing to the open-source codebase must negotiate a separate, commercial enterprise license. This guarantees that the infrastructure powering the commons is financially sustainable.

### III. The Protected Commons: 4D Bounded Hyperobjects (CERN-OHL-W-2.0)

The objects generated and curated within our library—the blueprints, the parametric `.scad` files, and their governing Manifests—are licensed under the **CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-W-2.0)**.

This is a deliberate rejection of both pure permissiveness (which invites exploitation) and total reciprocity (which prevents widespread adoption). The W variant respects the ontological boundary of the object.

* **Inside the Bounder (Forced Reciprocity):** The Manifest defines the core of the hyperobject—its internal algorithmic routing, its foundational geometry, its kinematic equations. If an architect or engineer uses Yantra4D to optimize, modify, or evolve these internal workings, they have altered the object itself. Under CERN-OHL-W-2.0, **they must publish these improvements back to the Commons.** This ensures our library perpetually evolves, absorbing the R&D of every entity that touches it.
* **Outside the Bounder (Freedom of Assembly):** The Manifest explicitly defines the "External Interfaces"—the mounting holes, the data sockets, the mating surfaces. If a user instantiates our open-source hyperobject and physically bolts a proprietary, highly classified, or commercially closed assembly onto those defined interfaces, the proprietary assembly **remains closed**.

### IV. The Pact of the Commons

This dual-license architecture prevents the digital tragedy of the commons by transforming our assets into participatory infrastructure.

We do not ask for charity; we enforce a symbiotic relationship. You are free to take our 4D Bounded Hyperobjects and integrate them into the largest, most proprietary industrial architectures on the planet. You are free to build empires on top of our external interfaces.

But the objects themselves belong to the Commons. If you improve the object, the object's evolution belongs to all of us. You may own the assembly, but the language of the forms—managed by Yantra4D and governed by the Bounder—remains free, reciprocal, and mathematically absolute via the **Geometric Parity Guarantee**.
