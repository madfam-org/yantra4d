# ⌬ Yantra4D: The Hyperobjects Commons

> **Manifest-driven parametric design for the decentralized manufacturing age.**

Yantra4D is not just a CAD tool; it is a **Poly-Kernel Engine** and a thriving **Hyperobjects Commons**. It bridges the mathematical precision of programmatic CAD with the accessibility of a visual, web-native storefront.

## 🛰️ The Vision: Hyperobjects & CDG
We are building the **Hyperobjects Commons** — a repository of "Bounded 4D Hyperobjects" designed for interoperability. By leveraging **Common Denominator Geometry (CDG)** interfaces (standardized snaps, threads, and joints), projects in the Yantra4D ecosystem can physically and mathematically interface with one another natively.

### 📼 Cartridge-Like Architecture
Every project in Yantra4D is a self-contained **"Cartridge"**. 
- **The Manifest**: A `project.json` file serves as the single source of truth, defining parameters, modes, and parts.
- **Poly-Kernel**: High-performance OpenSCAD (CSG) for browser-side WASM reactivity + mathematically exact CadQuery (B-Rep) for engineering-grade STEP exports.
- **Portability**: Drop a project folder into `projects/` and the platform instantly white-labels the UI to serve it.

---

## 🛠️ The Stack
- **CAD Engines**: Dual-execution via [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/).
- **The Studio**: React 19 + Three.js + Manifold-3d for blisteringly fast volumetric browser rendering.
- **The API**: Python Flask backend with Docker-orchestrated render clusters.
- **The Knowledge Base**: [4D Docs](https://4d-docs.madfam.io) — Powered by Astro Starlight.

## 📦 The Commons Catalog (36+ Projects)
From modular storage systems like **Gridfinity** to precision robotics like **SCARA Harmonic Drives**, the Commons provides a massive library of ready-to-print hyperobjects.

| Ecosystem | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gridfinity** | The world-standard modular storage system, optimized for WASM. |
| **Microscope Commons** | Standardized lab hardware including the **Slide-Holder** hyperobject. |
| **Fasteners** | Parametric bolts, nuts, and threads with exact B-Rep parity. |
| **Scara-Robotics** | High-precision parametric robotic limbs and reducers. |
