Welcome to the **Yantra4D Documentation**!

Yantra4D is an advanced open-source web platform for visualizing, configuring, and exporting Common Denominator Geometry (CDG) Parametric Hyperobjects.

## The Vision
We believe open-source hardware requires an ecosystem that provides intuitive visual parameterization. Yantra4D bridges the gap between text-based CAD scripts (like OpenSCAD and CadQuery B-Rep files) and user-friendly visual configuration tools.

## Architecture Let-Down
Through Yantra4D's integrated **Dual-Kernel Pipeline**:
- **OpenSCAD (CSG)** is compiled client-side via WebAssembly for immediate, high-performance UI parameter manipulation and rendering.
- **CadQuery (B-Rep)** is executed natively to map mathematically precise boundary configurations for standardized engineering pipelines.

### Let's Begin
Navigate to the [Studio Platform](/platform/studio/) to understand the core front-end client, or jump into the [Hyperobjects Commons](/commons/manifest-specs/) to understand the taxonomy of our models.
